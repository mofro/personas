## Working with Individual Personas

### Available Personas

**Development Expertise:**
- **@dylan_developer (Dylan Developer)**: Senior developer/architect with system design expertise
- **@johnny_blits (Johnny Blits)**: Lightning/Blits framework specialist for TV applications
- **@lucy_lightning (Lucy Lightning)**: Lightning v2 core framework expert
- **@riley_react (Riley React)**: Pragmatic React specialist who balances best practices with simplicity

**Design Expertise:**
- **@taylor_ten_foot (Taylor Ten-Foot)**: TV interface designer specializing in Lightning framework patterns

- **@dave_design (Dave Design)**: Cross-platform UX/UI strategist with strong design opinions

**Security Expertise:**
- **@samantha_security (Samantha Security)**: Application security expert focused on authentication and secure coding

### Addressing Personas

**Direct Engagement:**
```
@johnny_blits How should I structure this Blits component?
@samantha_security Review this authentication flow for vulnerabilities.
@dave_design What's wrong with this user interface approach?
```

**Natural Topic Routing:**
Ask domain-specific questions and the framework will automatically suggest relevant personas:
- "How do I secure user tokens?" â†’ Suggests @samantha_security
- "What's the best TV navigation pattern?" â†’ Suggests @johnny_blits or @taylor_ten_foot
- "Should I use React for this project?" â†’ Suggests @riley_react

## Advanced Features

### Discovery and Suggestions

**Context-Aware Recommendations:**
```
"suggest personas for this question"    # Get recommendations for current context
"enable discovery"                      # Turn on automatic suggestions
"disable discovery"                     # Turn off auto-suggestions
"scan for new personas"                # Refresh available persona pool
```

**Example Discovery Flow:**
```
You: "I need to implement OAuth authentication"
Framework: ðŸ’¡ Based on your authentication question, consider:
- Adding @samantha_security (security expertise)
- Activating security review team (comprehensive analysis)
Add with: "add security specialist" or "activate security team"
```

### Primary Voice System

**How Team Collaboration Works:**
- **Single Unified Response**: One persona speaks for the team, incorporating all expertise
- **Response Attribution**: Tags show which expertise contributed: `[SS]` = Security Specialist, `[BD]` = Blits Developer
- **Natural Handoffs**: Primary voice shifts when topics move outside current expertise
- **Optimistic Skepticism**: Framework challenges premises before providing solutions

**Example Collaborative Response:**
```
[RILEY_REACT] Before we jump into implementation, what specific problem does this solve?

Looking at this React component pattern... [SAMANTHA_SECURITY] we need to consider how props validation affects security, and [UMA_UX] the user experience implications of this state management approach.

[RILEY_REACT] Overall recommendation: simpler state management would serve your goals better.
```

## Performance Management

### Monitoring Framework Impact

**Current Session Metrics:**
```
"show performance metrics"

ðŸ“Š Session Performance
Active Team: React Development Team (6 personas)
Questions: 15 (12 with personas, 3 without)
Response Length: +85% vs base LLM
Estimated Overhead: ~20-25% context usage
User Engagement: High (active command usage)
```

**Historical Analysis:**
```
"metrics summary"

ðŸ“ˆ Usage Summary (Last 30 Days)
Most Used: @dylan_developer (89%), @samantha_security (67%)
Least Used: @database_expert (12%)
Average Response Length: +75% vs base LLM

ðŸ’¡ Optimization Suggestions:
- Consider removing unused personas
- Current team size effective for complex projects
```

**Performance Controls:**
```
"minimal persona mode"          # Reduce to essential expertise only
"monitoring mode"               # Enable detailed performance tracking  
"personas off"                  # Return to base LLM responses
```

### Optimization Strategies

**Team Size Guidelines:**

## Best Practices

### Effective Team Usage

**Start Small, Scale Up:**
1. Begin with coordinator persona only
2. Add expertise as questions become more complex
3. Use discovery suggestions rather than pre-loading large teams
4. Monitor performance impact and adjust accordingly

**Leverage Team Templates:**
- Use pre-configured teams for common workflows
- Save successful custom combinations as templates
- Share effective team compositions across projects

**Performance Awareness:**
- Monitor response length vs value trade-offs
- Use minimal mode for routine questions
- Turn off framework for simple tasks
- Regularly review usage metrics and optimize

### Collaboration Optimization

**Natural Interaction:**
- Let the framework suggest personas rather than manually managing large rosters
- Use direct addressing (`@persona_name`) for expertise handoffs
- Trust the primary voice system for unified responses
- Provide feedback to improve suggestion accuracy

**Quality Focus:**
- Challenge the framework's assumptions (it expects this!)
- Ask clarifying questions about expertise boundaries
- Request specific persona input when needed: "What does the security specialist think?"
- Use performance metrics to validate collaboration effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Framework Not Responding to Commands:**
- Ensure framework is activated: `"personas on"`
- Check available personas: `"list available personas"`
- Verify team exists: `"show my teams"`

**Personas Not Collaborating Effectively:**
- Try smaller team size for clearer responses
- Use direct addressing: `@persona_name`
- Request specific collaboration: `"get input from security and UX perspectives"`

**Performance Issues:**
- Switch to minimal mode: `"minimal persona mode"`
- Check current overhead: `"show performance metrics"`
- Deactivate unused personas: `"remove @persona_name"`

**Inconsistent Behavior:**
- Reinitialize framework: `"personas off"` then `"personas on"`
- Clear and rebuild team: `"clear team"` then rebuild
- Check for outdated schema files
