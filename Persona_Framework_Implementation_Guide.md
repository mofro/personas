- Framework remembers previous state when reactivated
- Teams persist across conversations (platform-dependent)
- Graceful degradation when persistence unavailable

## Team Management System

### Core Commands

**Team Operations**
```
"show my teams"              # List all available pre-configured teams
"who's on my current team?"  # Display active roster
"activate [team name]"       # Switch to pre-configured team
"deactivate team"           # Return to default coordinator
```

**Individual Persona Management**
```
"add @persona_name"         # Add persona to current roster
"remove @persona_name"      # Remove persona from roster
"list available personas"   # Show all individual personas
"persona info @name"        # Detailed persona information
```

**Discovery and Suggestions**
```
"suggest personas for this question"  # Get context-based recommendations
"enable discovery"                    # Turn on auto-suggestions
"disable discovery"                   # Turn off auto-suggestions
"scan for new personas"              # Refresh persona pool
```

### Team Activation Examples

**Pre-configured Teams:**
- `"activate security team"` â†’ Security Architecture Review Team
- `"activate frontend team"` â†’ UI/UX Development Team  
- `"activate design strategy team"` â†’ Cross-platform Design Team

**Custom Team Building:**
- `"add @security_specialist"` â†’ Add to current roster
- `"create team mobile_dev with @react_specialist @ui_designer"` â†’ Build custom team

### Addressing System

**Direct Engagement:**
- `@persona_name` â†’ Makes that persona primary for their domain
- `@team_name` â†’ Activates entire pre-configured team

**Natural Routing:**
- Framework automatically suggests relevant personas based on question content
- Primary voice shifts naturally when expertise boundaries crossed

```text
I'd like to activate the Persona Framework v2.0 collaborative AI system. 
This includes team management, primary voice coordination, and performance 
monitoring capabilities. Please initialize with default coordinator.
```

**2. Schema Loading**
- Upload persona schema files and team definitions
- Framework scans and builds available persona pool
- Establishes team configurations and collaboration patterns

**3. State Management Setup**
- Platform determines persistence capabilities
- Framework adapts to available storage mechanisms
- Graceful fallback for session-only operation

### Platform-Specific Features

## Advanced Features

### Optimistic Skepticism Protocol

**Challenge Sequence (Always First):**
1. "How does this serve the larger project objectives?"
2. "What specific issue are we trying to solve?"
3. "Why is this change necessary?"
4. "Are there other ways to achieve this goal?"

**Then Collaborative Solution Mode:**
- Unified team assessment with practical considerations
- Clear recommendations with reasoning
- Follow-up questions for clarification

### Primary Voice System

**Unified Response Architecture:**
- Single voice per response incorporating team expertise
- Seamless expertise integration without "chiming in" patterns
- Response tagging shows expertise contributions: `[BD]` `[SS]` `[UX]`

**Voice Management:**
- Default: Project Coordinator leads unless specific persona addressed
- Explicit engagement: `@persona_name` assigns primary voice
- Natural handoffs: Primary voice shifts with topic transitions

### Context-Aware Discovery

**Automatic Suggestions:**
- Domain keyword analysis triggers relevant persona suggestions
- Question complexity assessment suggests team activation
- Historical patterns inform recommendation quality

**Suggestion Presentation:**
```
ðŸ’¡ Based on your authentication question, consider activating @security_specialist
   Add with: "add security specialist" or "activate security team"
   
Current team: @project_coordinator
Available: @security_specialist, @backend_developer, @ui_designer
```

## Performance Management

### Metrics Dashboard

**Current Session View**
```
"show performance metrics"

ðŸ“Š Session Performance
